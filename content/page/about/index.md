## Bio

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Michael O'Connell. I play in two bands, [Factotem](https://www.facebook.com/Factotem/) and [Keep Sketch](https://www.facebook.com/keepsketchband/), in which I am both a drummer and a songwriter. I write a tonne of music, some of which I decide to sing, and record by myself. This is a place for that music.

## What I'm up to

For the new year, 2022 I've got a plan to post a piece of content everyday, except for Sundays. I want to commit to this so that I am more active on social media, and so that there is some accountability if I'm not being active! 

### What kind of content?

This will be audio clips or videos of whatever song I'm currently writing, it may also be images, maybe of album art or a cool mixing trick I've come across.

I'm most looking forward to seeing peoples reactions to songs that I'm writing and sharing that process which is usually hidden from view whenever I write music for myself, Keep Sketch or Factotem.
