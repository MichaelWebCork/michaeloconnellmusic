## Feb 10th - Added lyrics to chorus and added a post chorus idea
Same song again today, I've added a lyric / vocal idea to the chorus. Just imagine that it's sang up an octave! I've also added a post chorus piece that's made up of a variation on the main riff and the chords to the chorus played over it in stabs with the drums.

I didn't post any video progress of this song. I think that's what I will do for tomorrow's post ðŸ™‚

Oh and the photo is one of Keep Sketch, nothing to do with today's post but I needed an image! Check out our music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1uSGXmU6ruQSodW4YRVfEp)
