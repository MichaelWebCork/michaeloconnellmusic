## Feb 11th - All parts finished just missing lyrics
I've pretty much finished the bones of writing this song. It's got a chorus, verse, intro, solo and ending. It will change once I actually have lyrics for it or if and when I bring it to one of the bands I work with. 

I'll post a video of creating this song soon enough, but I'll move on to some other tune next week I think.
