## Feb 14th - Worked on some more ideas for the song Campo and I are writing
Worked on some more rough ideas for the song Campo and I are writing after rehearsals on Saturday. We're liking the ideas, obviously it needs refining but we like the structure and ideas so far. We'll probably work more on the lyrics, in fact Campo message me today about them. Then once we have the lyrics we'll go back and do some more work arranging the song. Finally we'll make a proper recording.
