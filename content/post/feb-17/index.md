## Feb 17th - No new music today, but heres a bit of a write up about playing a wedding
One of my bands was asked to play a wedding, not a traditional wedding set but a pop-punk / rock set. Sounds right up our alley! 
I spent today, and last night sorting out the detials with Campo and checking that the lads were on board. Campo put together a rough setlist of songs on Spotify for us to consider and which I spent 3 hours listening to today and trying to imagine how it would sound at a wedding. 
We also spent a load of time discussing the best way to get to Offaly from Cork with a tonne of instruments, pa system and ourseleves. We've settled on either renting a van and hauling gear with one of us driving a car full with the other lads. Or renting gear if there is a equipment rental company in Offaly, if not there should be!
