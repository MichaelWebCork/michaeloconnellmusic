## Feb 18th - Rehearsals today with 3/4 of Factotem, Rob has learned the songs on guitar
A little late, a day to be exact, posting this but after rehearsal and dinner I was much too tired to post! Although I did upload the video to instagram :)
Here we're practising a song off our second EP that we released, Princess Rob and the Biscuits. The song is called She's Strange but She's Nice, a song with a lot of weight behind the lyrics probably better explained by Rob someday. Maybe I'll convince him to guest post.
During this nights rehearsals Rob, our singer, had learned most of the songs on our ~30 min set that we hope to get back gigging soon! As somebody who up to this point only knew how to play a handful of open chords he's picked the rhythm parts to these songs fairly quickly. There's plenty more songs in our backlog to learn, and he'll also need to learn all of the songs from our next album, which is written, recorded and mixed but has been sitting in limbo for the last 2 or 3 years thanks to Covid ruining our plans.
Speaking of learning songs, we continued work on a song that myself and Campo were writing with Rob's input last night. It's starting to come together lyrically and we're excited to keep writing it. That will probably be a Keep Sketch song, maybe Rob will learn the Keep Sketch songs on guitar and we might actually gig. Originally we were planning on just recording and releasing music, but the attention whores we are why not gig also.
