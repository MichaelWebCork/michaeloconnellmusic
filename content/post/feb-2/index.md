## Feb 2nd - More Musescore today, learning how to add two voices, Factotem's Mood Ring
Mood Ring is a song we've played many times live and have recorded and ready to go for an upcoming album, which has been ready for a long time but due to covid and all that we still haven't released it! Someday... anyway, I've tabbed out both parts today in the hopes of making it easier for our new guitarist to learn and our singer Rob to learn the harmony part, guitar two.
