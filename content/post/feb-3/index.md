## Feb 3rd - Bed Sheets and Covers, or the multiple times I've tried to start a wedding band
If it's not known, let it be known that apart from Factotem and Keep Sketch I am also in another band, "Bed Sheets and Covers". Probably the band with the best name that I am in. We haven't played too much really. Life and other commitments got in the way multiple times and we never really got ourselves off the ground, except for a few college balls that we played. 

Anyway, now that gigs are back, myself and the other fella, have decided it may be a good idea to get the coverband back together. 

Today, and probably the rest of tonight after posting this, was and will be spent combing through all the songs that we had learned previously, trimming the fat and trying to decide which songs should be added. 

We also haven't asked any of the other guys in the band yet! So the band may not even happen, lets see. I'll keep yopu posted :)
