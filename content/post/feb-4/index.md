## Feb 4th - New song with Campo, very early stages
We were supposed to practice with Factotem tonight, unfortunately covid has caused two of the lads to not be able to make it.

So Campo and I wanted to work on some new music, no ideas were coming out so we had a look at the scraps of songs on the computer in our rehearsal room. There was one bad vocal and bad guitar track but the idea sounds cool and so we ran with it. Currently the song is a sort of brain dump of branching ideas, we'll see how it evolves over the next few iterations :)
