## Feb 5th - Worked on ideas for Yesterdays new song
No video or audio today, as no ideas really came out of the session. 
I was trying to work on some parts for the song Campo and I had started working on yesterday. Mainly I was trying to make a chourus but I just cannot hear where the song wants to go next, and so I've spent a lot of time trying things that didn't work out. I'm thinking this one may need to sit for a while and maybe Campo and I will revisit it together to see if we can make any progress. 
I think my problem with the song currently is I usually need a solid idea of what I want the story to be before I move onto a chorus. This song is currently made up of two different lyrical backgrounds which is making the next part a bit confused in my mind. 
If I sit on the song for a while and listen to what we have so far often a story might emerge and maybe then I'll find where the song wants to go.
