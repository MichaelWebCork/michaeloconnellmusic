## Feb 6th - Another new idea today based off of two write that down's 
I didn't want to work on the song that Campo and I were working on as I have no new ideas for it. So I wanted to start something new. Couldn't think of anything interesting so played a few chords and looked through some of Robs write that down's. I found two that stood out "can't you wait to kill me" and another something like "I probably shouldn't have said anything, but that wouldn't be me". With those chords and the lyrics becoming "Can't you wait to kill me, I shouldn't have said anything, but that wouldn't be me" a song is born, or the beginnings of one at lest. I ditched the chords, wrote a bit of a riff, and then added some chords back in underneath with a simple drum loop just to get the point across. Here's the early version, no vocals on it because I just recorded the vocal idea on my phone. More from this song soon.
