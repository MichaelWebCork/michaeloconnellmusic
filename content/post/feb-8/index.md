## Feb 8th - Yesterdays song continues, working title can't you wait to kill me 
Same song that I posted on Feb 7th but changed up a little bit. I've now moved the vocal to be over a clean electric guitar. I've also moved the riff up an octave and have it playing after the vocal with the rest of the music. I'm thinking the vocal + clean guitar on it's on then explode into the riff with full on drums, guitar and bass, and then tighten up everything for a verse. We'll see soon enough.
