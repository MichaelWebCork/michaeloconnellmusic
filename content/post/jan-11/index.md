## Jan 11th, Day 2 That Same New Song Continued 
Today was spent coming up with ideas for the song I was working on yesterday. I removed that bass line in the chorus and added a tonne of different part that probably won't make it to the final version. In this video I'm putting the final touches on the initial rough arrangement. I'll probably send some time on another idea before coming back to this and adding melodies and lyrics.
