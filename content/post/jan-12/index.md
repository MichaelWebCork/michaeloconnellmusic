## Jan 12th, Day 3 The beginings of a song I've been working on 
"Were we born like this" is now the current working title based off of the first lyric idea I've had for the song I've been working on recently. I like the ideas in this and the structure, the sounds and playing need improvement. I'll sit on this one for a while maybe write some lyrics and see where the song goes.

I've added this to an "album", more like a playlist, on BandCamp that will host any work inprogress songs. The album is called "#mocdaily - music in progress". Check it out here [https://michaeloc.bandcamp.com/track/jan-12th-were-we-born-like-this](https://michaeloc.bandcamp.com/track/jan-12th-were-we-born-like-this) or play it on the player above.
