## Jan 13th - The beginnings of a new song, writing music 
Today I spent some time adding a new section to the beginnings of a song I've had sitting on my hard-drive for a while. You can see a bit of my workflow, developing a part on guitar, sampling the notes and playing them back using a midi-keyboard to get a more interesting sound. More of this song to come.
