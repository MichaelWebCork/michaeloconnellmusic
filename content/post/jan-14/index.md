## Jan 14th - Writing a bass line for yesterdays song 
In this video I'm working out a bass line for the song I was working on during Jan 13th. I have the other section of the song already written, so now this is two sections minus lyrics and vocal melody. I'm not exactly sure yet what will be the chorus and what will be a verse. I think this part might be the chorus, or maybe a pre-chorus, we'll see.
