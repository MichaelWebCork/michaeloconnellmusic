## Jan 17th - The song I've been working on, and struggling to find a chorus
This is a bounce down of the song I've been working on for the last few days. I tried to add some more to it yesterday and couldn't get into it, and again today I tried to add to it but couldn't find a chorus. I might need to sit on this one again for a while and come back to it with a fresh head. So I'll probably work on a new piece of music tomorrow. Here is the progress so far for you to listen to. I'll also write a little about my song writing process to make todays post a bit more interesting. 

### Write that down
Many of the songs I write be it for Factotem, Keep Sketch, myself or any other project I'm working on start with the words "write that down", exclaimed loudly by one of three people. Namely myself, Anthony Meaney and Rob Allen, the later being the most fruitful source of "write that down".
Write that down takes the form of a Facebook group chat that serves one purpose, if one of us says something that we thing would make a cool lyric, we write it down and send it to the group chat. We have built up a huge collection of lyric ideas this way. 

### Noodling and Looping
I spend too much of my limited free time noodling on guitar and looping the results. If there is something I like there I might skim through the list of lyrics in the "write that down" group chat. Humming melodies and looking for lines that fit within the melody and syllables. Often times I'll find one lyric that stands out and although it may need some reshaping to fit the music, or reshaping of the music to fit the lyric, it will plant a seed that hopefully will become a song. Most of the time this process produces just a single verse or chorus and often is nothing more that a single line with a guitar riff and midi drums. 

### Moving on and forgetting
The next step is to get frustrated and move on to something else. Something new exciting and fun, or something old exciting and fun, either way not the current song. Eventually I'll come back and be either pleasantly surprised or end up deleting the studio one project in one of my hard-drive clean-outs.
If I like the song after this time, it will probably grow a little by repeating the "write that down" and "noodling and looping" steps before being left alone again. 

### Finishing the writing
Songs can finish being written in three ways.

1. I get fed up, or dislike everything about it and delete it. Done. 
2. I finish writing the song alone and end up with a demo that I am happy with and ready to record with one of the bands I am in or by my lonesome. 
3. I can't figure out where to go next, but don't dislike what I've done so far. These songs get brought to the most suitable project, Factotem, Keep Sketch etc... There we'll work together as a group to finish the songwriting and create a song that way. 

### Recording and releasing 
Too much to write here, I'll save that for another day.
