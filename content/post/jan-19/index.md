## Jan 19th - Tabbing out Factotems Monogamy Queen for Factotem's singer and our new guitar player
I spent some time today trying to figure out musescore, it's a great free music notation program. I have a pretty limited understanding of written music but I've done my best here, and it gets the point accross when combined with the actual recording of the song on Spotify.
