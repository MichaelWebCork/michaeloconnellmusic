## Jan 21st - Today I worked on a vocal melody and bit of lyrics for a song I've been writing
Today I worked on a vocal melody and bit of lyrics for a song I've been writing over the last few days. This is my usual vocal writing process, sitting at a computer looping various bits of the song, humming along and trying to find melodies and lyrics.
