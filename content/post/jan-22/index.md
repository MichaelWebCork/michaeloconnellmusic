## Jan 22nd - Relearning Factotem songs Today, and teaching the chords to our singer
Today was spent running Rob through playing a few of our songs. Rob doesn't usually play guitar in Factotem but has been wanting to start re-enforcing choruses and adding rhythm guitar to sound more like the recordings live. Today was all about getting chords and structures to songs.
