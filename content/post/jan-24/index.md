## Jan 24 - Me videoing Campo, videoing Rob, videoing himself recording vocals for Shes Strange
I couldn't get any time to make music, or do anything really productive musically today, so I thought I'd share a look into what a recording session looks like for Factotem.

Here's me videoing Campo, videoing Rob, videoing himself recording vocals for Shes Strange.

I got reminded of this song recently, Saturday in fact, during rehearsals. We've been teaching Rob, Factotem's singer how to play the songs on guitar. Shes Strange is a song that we wrote for the EP Princess Rob and the Biscuits. It's a song that means a lot to us, and probably better explained by Rob, and so we're extremely proud of this song. This was recorded not long after we released our first album, December 2016 I think. It's funny to look back at how we recorded this in a kitchen!

You can listen to the actual song on Spotify, Apple Music, BandCamp etc...
