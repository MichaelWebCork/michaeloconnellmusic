## Jan 29th - Adding a riff to the chorus and some other bits
This video is a bit late, a day late, I used a different camera that had a variable frame rate, which my editing software didn't like. I had to convert everything and it took way too long. Anyway the song is really coming together at this point. There is more footage of making the final chorus so I'll post that Monday, for now here's some me adding a riff to whats become the chorus and adding bits and bobs around the song.
