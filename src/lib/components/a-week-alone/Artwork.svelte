      A story about the album art. This release and my previous release called “whatever” both host a baby photo of me as the art. This photo is of an old vhs tape my Mam has lying around. It’s myself, as a baby, attempting to smoke one of my sister Catherines fags. I believe they were John Player Silk Cut Purples. “They were sopping wet”, my sister recalls. Additionally, although not visible, I have a bic lighter in my hand which I’m intently using to try and spark up.
